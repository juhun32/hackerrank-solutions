[Integers Come In All Sizes](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/python-integers-come-in-all-sizes/problem?isFullScreen=true)

---
Integers in Python can be as big as the bytes in your machine's memory. There is no limit in size as there is: 2^31 - 1 (c++ int) or 2^63 - 1 (C++ long long int).

As we know, the result of  grows really fast with increasing .

Let's do some calculations on very large integers.

## Task
Read four numbers, a, b, c, and d, and print the result of a^b + c^d.

---

## Input Format
Integers a, b, c, and d are given on four separate lines, respectively.

---

## Output Format
Print the result of a^b + c^d on one line.
