[List Comprehensions](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/list-comprehensions/problem?isFullScreen=true)

---

## Task
Let's learn about list comprehensions! You are given three integers x,y and z representing the dimensions of a cuboid along with an integer n. Print a list of all possible coordinates given by (i,j,k) on a 3D grid where the sum of i+j+k is not equal to n. Here, 0 <= i <= x; 0 <= j <= y; 0 <= k <= z. Please use list comprehensions rather than multiple loops, as a learning exercise.

## Input Format
Four integers x,y,z and n, each on a separate line.
